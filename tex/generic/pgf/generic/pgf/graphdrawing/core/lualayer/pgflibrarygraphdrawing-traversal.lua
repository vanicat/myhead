--- Iterator for traversing a directed \meta{graph} using a topological sorting.
--
-- A topological sorting of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its
-- nodes such that, for every edge |(u,v)|, |u| comes before |v|.
--
-- Important note: if performed on a graph with at least one cycle a
-- topological sorting is impossible. Thus, the nodes returned from the
-- iterator are not guaranteed to satisfy the ``|u| comes before |v|''
-- criterion. The iterator may even terminate early or loop forever.
--
-- @param graph A directed acyclic graph.
--
-- @return An iterator for traversing \meta{graph} in a topological order.
