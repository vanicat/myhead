--- Implementation of the popular spring-based algorithm for drawing graphs.
--
-- This is an implementation of a force-based graph drawing algorithm that
-- assumes the nodes are electrically charged particles that push each other
-- away while the edges simulate springs that keep the nodes together.
--
-- The result is a set of repulsive forces between nodes and attractive
-- forces between connected nodes. These forces are applied to the 
-- corresponding nodes which results in a single movement force for each
-- node. This force is then used to move the nodes to a better position. 
--
-- A high number of iterations of this procedure is needed for the 
-- positions of the nodes to stabilize. 
--
-- The code of this implementation is based on the spring layouter
-- written by Johannes Textor for DAGitty (http://dagitty.net).
--
-- @param graph   The graph to draw.
-- @param options Options passed to the algorithm from TikZ.
